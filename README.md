<h1> Cheese Grits </h1> </head>
<h2> By Kennedi Brownlee </h2>
<body>
<p> Grits are a food that I tend to eat on a very consistent basis. This is my own spin on traditional southern cheese grits.</p>
<h3> Ingredients </h3>
<ul> 
    <li> 4 cups chicken broth or stock</li>
    <li> 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt </li>
    <li> 1 cup coarse ground cornmeal </li>
    <li> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li> 1 stick unsalted butter </li>
    <li> 5 ounces sharp cheddar, shredded </li>
</ul>
<h4> What to do </h4>
<ol>
    <li> Place the chicken broth, water, and salt into a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat and bring to a boil.</li>
    <li> Once the milk mixture comes to a boil, gradually add the cornmeal while continually whisking </li>
    <li>Once all of the cornmeal has been incorporated, decrease the heat to low and cover. Remove lid and whisk frequently, every 3 to 4 minutes, to prevent grits from sticking or forming lumps.</li>
    <li>Cook for 20 to 25 minutes or until mixture is creamy.</li>
    <li> Remove from the heat, add the pepper and butter, and whisk to combine </li>
    <li> Once the butter is melted, gradually whisk in the cheese a little at a time. Serve immediately.</li>
</ol>
